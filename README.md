jquery.fakebutton
=================

Make an element respond like a button - to keyboard, mouse and touch events.

Syntax is simply $('#my-element').fakebutton() and $('#my-element').unfakebutton() to remove.

Fires "click" events when applicable, and adds an "active" class to the element when pressed down.

You can specify a tabIndex attribute as the first argument.
